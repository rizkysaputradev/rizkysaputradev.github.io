      Hello, I am Rizky Johan Saputra. I am a graduating student at

      </a>
      at the early of March 2021 and graduated at late February of 2026. Academically, I have always had an interest
      in the concepts of

      Nevertheless, I still eager to implement hardware based systems due to how crucial and complex yet fascinating 
      these systems are when it is operationalized in congruent to the recurring development of software and AI based systems. 
      Currently, I have developed various low and high level systems such as memory allocators and real-time architectures into

      My current interest and focus leaned towards advanced AI and hardware/software codesign systems. For more details,
