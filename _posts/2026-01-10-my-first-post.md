## Status and Vision
Hi, welcome to my very first blog. My name is Rizky Johan Saputra. I am a recently graduated B.S. student
from the department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Seoul National University (SNU). Currently,
I am quite busy with pursuing internships and masters degree at in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI). 
I enjoy building systems where the rules are explicit through its invariants, constraints and predictable behavior,
yet remains applicable into a real-life system. Currently, I am experiencing a huge burnout as I have just finished 
my last semester here at SNU and the graduation process was a hassle. Ironic considering I did a thesis about a 
burnout and got it myself. However, things have been doing well for me and I just hope I can find peace at the moment.
I wished that things will not be as bad this year of 2026 because I have been going through a lot of trial and
tribulations, but what is more important is to always stand up and go through the storm.

## Personal Message
This period of my life marks a huge transition. Finishing my undergraduate journey has given me both clarity and uncertainty.
Clarity in what I value as an engineer and as a person, and uncertainty in how the next steps will unfold. There were moments 
of exhaustion, self-doubt, and frustration, but these moments also forced me to slow down and reassess what kind of work and 
life I want to build for myself. I am learning that progress does not always move in straight lines and not everything will go
your way. What matters most to me now is continuing to learn and live with care and purpose, and to move forward even when the 
path is not fully visible. As long as curiosity and effort remains, I believe meaningful outcomes will eventually follow.

## Creative interests
I also like things that sharpen perception and maintain my healt such as:

- Photography 
- Fragrance
- Music across genres and cultures
- Cooking
- Gym / Working Out
