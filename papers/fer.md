## Abstract
Occupational burnout and chronic psychological distress have become critical systemic challenges within academic and corporate ecosystems. Conventional diagnostic frameworks primarily utilize psychometric instruments, such as the **Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)**; however, these self-reporting methodologies are often compromised by **subjectivity**, **social desirability bias**, and **retrospective recall inaccuracies**. This thesis presents a novel computational framework that utilizes **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)** to provide an objective, longitudinal, and non-intrusive quantification of burnout markers.

The architecture employs a hybrid deep learning approach, integrating **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for high-dimensional spatial feature extraction with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to capture temporal dependencies in facial micro-expressions. The pipeline ingests real-time video streams, maps facial configurations to discrete emotion probability distributions, and derives a composite **stress index** by applying weighted coefficients to negative valence states. 

To ensure empirical rigor, the system’s predictive outputs are benchmarked against validated psychometric data. A centralized analytics dashboard facilitates the visualization of cross-sectional and multi-session stress trajectories. **Pearson correlation analysis** reveals a significant statistical convergence between FER-derived metrics and established burnout scales. This research underscores the efficacy of biometrically-driven affective computing as a scalable diagnostic tool for psychological health monitoring in high-stakes environments, such as healthcare and pedagogy.
